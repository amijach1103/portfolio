# Professional Bio

**Agueda Schwartz**
Product Manager
MA, Digital Media Design for Learning, New York University

Agueda drives innovation pilots at WGU Labs, bringing structure to early-stage ideas through landscape analysis, strategic research, and human-centered design. Her current focus is exploring AI as a working partner in learning contexts — building workflows that maximize quality while creating space for upskilling and supporting others. She draws on 14+ years of EdTech experience across a variety of roles, including product owner, program evaluation lead, and learning experience designer. Her experience spans K-12, higher education, and corporate learning environments. While at Labs, she has been instrumental in shaping how the team approaches early-stage innovation, turning ambiguous challenges into actionable plans with measurable outcomes. Agueda operates from the belief that education is a lever for equity — one that works best when it's personal, efficient, and focused on capability rather than compliance. Agueda earned her Master's in Digital Media Design for Learning from New York University and her Bachelor's in Educational Psychology from Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú. She holds certifications in Designing Strategy and Designing a Business from IDEO U. Born and raised in Peru and now based in NYC, she spends her free time exploring new restaurants, walking the city with her dog, and reading — preferably with a good cup of coffee.
