# Systematic Landscape Analysis

**Use When:**
- Starting a new product initiative and need market context
- Evaluating go/no-go decisions with evidence
- Building competitive intelligence for stakeholder presentations
- Validating or challenging assumptions about a market

**Avoid When:**
- You need real-time data (use live dashboards instead)
- The question is narrow enough for a single search
- You're looking for internal company data (not publicly available)

**Time Investment:** 3-4 hours
**Traditional Approach:** 2-3 weeks
**Time Savings:** ~85%

## The Template

```
I need a comprehensive landscape analysis for [PROJECT] that examines [PROBLEM].

Project Context:
- Industry/Sector: [e.g., Education, EdTech, Higher Ed]
- Specific Problem/Opportunity: [describe the core question]
- Target Audience/Market: [who this serves]
- Geographic Scope: [e.g., United States, Global]
- Current Stage: [e.g., ideation, validation, development]

Research Areas - Please analyze:
1. Existing Solutions & Competitors (who's already doing this?)
2. What's Worked (success stories, best practices, case studies)
3. What Hasn't Worked (failures, common pitfalls, cautionary tales)
4. Market Trends & Dynamics (growth, investment, adoption patterns)
5. Gaps & White Spaces (unmet needs, underserved segments)
6. User/Customer Insights (pain points, behaviors, preferences)

Research Requirements:
- Prioritize sources from the last 2 years (90% recency target)
- Include diverse source types: government, academic, industry reports, nonprofit research
- Cross-verify key statistics across independent sources
- Provide inline citations throughout

Output Structure:
- Executive Summary (key takeaways, strategic implications)
- Detailed findings for each research area
- Competitive Matrix (compare 5-8 major players)
- Strategic Recommendations (evidence-based, specific)
- Key Questions for Further Exploration (gaps identified)
- References (APA 7th edition format)
- Methodology Notes (transparency on search approach)

Please be comprehensive yet concise, focusing on actionable insights.
```

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `[PROJECT]` | Name or description of your initiative | "AI-powered entrepreneurship platform" |
| `[PROBLEM]` | Core question you're investigating | "how to help aspiring entrepreneurs launch businesses with AI assistance" |
| `Industry/Sector` | Market category | "Higher Education, EdTech" |
| `Specific Problem/Opportunity` | What you're trying to understand | "Whether students want educational content or operational tools" |
| `Target Audience/Market` | Who you're building for | "Adult learners with business ideas, 25-45 age range" |
| `Geographic Scope` | Market boundaries | "United States initially, potential global expansion" |
| `Current Stage` | Where you are in product development | "Ideation - evaluating whether to pursue" |

## What Good Output Looks Like

### Executive Summary Section
> **Key Finding:** The AI entrepreneurship tools market is bifurcating into educational platforms (teaching business skills) and operational platforms (automating business tasks). Educational platforms show 3x higher user retention but 40% lower revenue per user. Operational platforms face higher churn but command premium pricing.
>
> **Strategic Implication:** A phased approach—starting with education to build user base, then layering operational tools—mirrors successful precedents (HubSpot, Mailchimp) and reduces market entry risk.

### Competitive Matrix Sample

| Company | Focus | Funding | Users | Strength | Weakness |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| Company A | Educational | $50M | 100K | Content library | No execution tools |
| Company B | Operational | $120M | 25K | Full-stack platform | High complexity |
| Company C | Hybrid | $30M | 45K | Balanced approach | Jack of all trades |

### Citations Example
> According to the U.S. Small Business Administration (2024), 20% of new businesses fail within the first year, with "lack of planning" cited as the primary factor in 42% of failures (SBA, 2024). This aligns with findings from the Kauffman Foundation (2023) showing that entrepreneurs who complete structured planning programs are 2.5x more likely to secure funding.

## Critical Success Factors

### User Preference Required
Set this user preference in Claude for maximum quality:
> "Validate each fact always and make sure any claim or statement is supported by a relevant, accessible and valid source. Make sure all artifacts have a 'references' section in APA format."

This single setting transforms output from "plausible" to "presentation-ready."

### Source Diversity Checklist
Ensure your analysis includes:
- [ ] Government sources (SBA, Census, regulatory bodies)
- [ ] Academic research (peer-reviewed studies, university reports)
- [ ] Industry reports (analyst firms, trade associations)
- [ ] Nonprofit/advocacy (foundations, research organizations)
- [ ] Case studies (company blogs, press coverage, post-mortems)

### Recency Filter
- 90% of sources should be from the last 2 years
- Flag any older sources and note why they're still relevant
- For fast-moving markets (AI, crypto), prioritize last 6-12 months

## Follow-Up Patterns

After the initial landscape analysis, use these follow-ups:

### Deep Dive on Competitors
```
Based on the landscape analysis, I need a deeper competitive analysis of [COMPETITOR].
Focus on: product features, pricing model, user reviews, recent news, funding history, and strategic direction.
```

### Identify Counter-Arguments
```
Play devil's advocate on this analysis. What are the strongest arguments against the strategic recommendation? What data might I be missing or misinterpreting?
```

### Extract Interview Questions
```
Based on these findings, what questions should I ask in user interviews to validate or challenge the key assumptions?
```

### Executive Summary Only
```
Distill this landscape analysis into a 1-page executive summary using this structure:
- Strategic Tension (the core decision we face)
- Recommendation (what we should do)
- Key Evidence (3-5 supporting data points)
- Risks & Mitigations
- Next Steps (specific, actionable)
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Too broad a scope | Narrow to specific market segment or geography |
| Outdated sources dominate | Explicitly request recency filter |
| Missing competitive nuance | Request separate competitor deep-dives |
| No actionable recommendations | Add "Strategic Recommendations" to required output |
| Unverified statistics | "Validate each fact always" user preference |

## Real-World Application

**Project:** Vibe Entrepreneurship Platform (WGU Labs)
**Research Time:** 3-4 hours
**Sources Analyzed:** 50+
**Output Used For:** CEO presentation, go/no-go decision

**Result:** Identified phased hybrid strategy (educational → operational) that reconciled conflicting survey data with market opportunity analysis. Executive buy-in achieved.
