# Executive Summary Framework

**Use When:**
- Presenting recommendations to C-level executives
- Distilling complex research into decision-ready format
- Stakeholder updates that require action
- Board or leadership presentations

**Avoid When:**
- Audience wants to explore options (use decision matrix instead)
- You don't have a clear recommendation yet
- The topic requires detailed technical explanation

**Time Investment:** 30 minutes - 1 hour
**Traditional Approach:** 4-6 hours of deck iteration
**Time Savings:** ~75%

## The Framework

**Structure:** Tension → Recommendation → Rationale → Implications → Next Steps

### Why This Works

Executives don't want:
- All your research details
- Multiple options without a recommendation
- Vague follow-ups like "we should explore this further"

Executives want:
- The decision they need to make
- Your recommended path (you did the work, take a stance)
- Evidence they can trust
- Clear next steps they can approve or redirect

---

## The Template

```
I need to create an executive summary for [AUDIENCE] about [TOPIC].

Context:
- Decision needed: [what they need to decide]
- Deadline/urgency: [timeline]
- Key stakeholders: [who else is involved]
- Their concerns: [what keeps them up at night about this]

Use this structure:

1. STRATEGIC TENSION (2-3 sentences)
Frame the core decision. What are the competing paths? Why is this hard?
Example: "We face a choice between X and Y. X offers [benefit] but risks [downside]. Y offers [benefit] but risks [downside]."

2. RECOMMENDATION (1 sentence, bold)
State your recommendation with confidence. No hedging.
Example: "We recommend pursuing X with a phased approach."

3. RATIONALE (3-5 bullets)
Evidence-based support for your recommendation. Each bullet should be:
- Specific (numbers, sources)
- Relevant (addresses their concerns)
- Verifiable (they could check if they wanted)

4. IMPLICATIONS (2-3 bullets)
What does this mean in practice?
- Financial impact
- Timeline impact
- Resource requirements
- Risk factors

5. NEXT STEPS (2-3 specific actions)
What do you need from them? What happens next?
Each step should be:
- Specific (not "explore options" but "approve $X budget for Phase 1")
- Owned (who does what)
- Time-bound (by when)

Keep total length under 1 page. Executives skim.
```

## Example Output

### Topic: AI Entrepreneurship Platform Direction

---

**STRATEGIC TENSION**

We face a choice between building an educational product (teaching entrepreneurship skills) or an operational product (helping users actually launch businesses). Our survey of 212 students shows strong interest in learning (73.6% have business ideas), while market analysis reveals the operational space has higher revenue potential but more competition.

**RECOMMENDATION**

**Pursue a phased hybrid strategy: launch with educational content (Phase 1), then layer operational tools (Phase 2).**

**RATIONALE**

- Survey data validates demand: 73.6% of respondents have business ideas and expressed interest in AI-assisted entrepreneurship learning
- Phased approach reduces risk: Educational products have proven business models and 3x higher retention rates (Kauffman Foundation, 2023)
- Precedent exists: HubSpot followed this exact path—taught inbound marketing, then built CRM platform—achieving $1.7B ARR
- Competitive positioning: Phase 1 builds user base and trust; Phase 2 leverages that relationship for operational upsell
- Timeline alignment: Phase 1 can launch in Q2; Phase 2 development starts Q3 informed by user feedback

**IMPLICATIONS**

- **Investment:** $X for Phase 1 (content development, platform MVP); Phase 2 scope TBD based on learnings
- **Timeline:** Phase 1 launch Q2 2026; Phase 2 evaluation Q4 2026
- **Risk:** If Phase 1 underperforms, we've validated market assumptions at lower cost than full operational build

**NEXT STEPS**

1. **Approve Phase 1 scope and budget** — CEO decision by [date]
2. **Assign product lead** — Research Director to confirm by [date]
3. **Kick off content partnership discussions** — Product team begins outreach week of [date]

## Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `[AUDIENCE]` | Who will read this | "CEO and Research Director" |
| `[TOPIC]` | What you're presenting | "AI entrepreneurship platform strategic direction" |
| `Decision needed` | The specific choice | "Go/no-go on platform development; if go, educational vs. operational focus" |
| `Deadline/urgency` | Why now | "Board meeting in 2 weeks; need aligned recommendation" |
| `Their concerns` | What they worry about | "Resource allocation, market timing, competitive differentiation" |

---

## Tone Calibration

### For CEOs
- Lead with business impact
- Use revenue/cost language
- Keep it to half a page if possible
- End with clear decision point

### For Research Directors
- Include methodology confidence notes
- Reference data sources
- Acknowledge limitations
- More detail acceptable (3/4 page)

### For Boards
- Strategic framing over tactical detail
- Market context and competitive positioning
- Risk/reward clearly articulated
- Governance-appropriate next steps

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Burying the recommendation | Lead with it (after tension framing) |
| Hedging language ("perhaps," "might consider") | Take a stance—that's your job |
| Too many next steps | Maximum 3; they won't remember more |
| Vague implications | Specific numbers, dates, owners |
| Including all your research | That's what appendices are for |

---

## Follow-Up Patterns

### If They Push Back
```
The executive challenged [specific concern]. Help me strengthen the rationale or identify if we need to revise the recommendation. What additional evidence would address their concern?
```

### If They Want Options
```
Convert this recommendation into a decision matrix showing 3 options:
1. [Your recommendation]
2. [Alternative A]
3. [Alternative B - including "do nothing"]

For each: investment required, timeline, risk level, expected outcome.
```

### If They Approve
```
Create an implementation brief based on the approved recommendation. Include:
- 90-day action plan
- Resource requirements
- Success metrics
- Risk mitigation steps
- Communication plan for broader team
```
