# Experiment: Reconciling Conflicting Data Sources

> **Status:** Initial observation — One strong example; looking for more opportunities to test this pattern.

**Date:** November 2025
**Hypothesis:** When primary research contradicts secondary research, the answer isn't to pick one—it's to find the frame where both are true
**Initial Result:** "Both/and" thinking produced stronger strategic recommendations than "either/or" in this case
**Verdict:** Promising — needs more examples to confirm pattern

## Setup

### The Conflict

During the Vibe Entrepreneurship project, I had two data sources telling me different things:

**Primary Research (Survey):**
- 212 WGU student responses
- 73.6% have business ideas they want to pursue
- Strong interest in *learning* entrepreneurship skills
- Signal: Build an **educational** product

**Secondary Research (Landscape Analysis):**
- 50+ market sources analyzed
- Operational tools (helping people *do* business tasks) showing higher growth
- Educational content market is crowded
- Signal: Build an **operational** product

### Initial Instinct
Pick the "better" data source:
- Survey = direct from users, but small sample, potentially biased
- Landscape = broader market view, but not our specific users

This felt like a trap either way.

## The Experiment

### Prompt Used
```
I have conflicting data about product direction:

Survey (n=212):
- 73.6% have business ideas
- Strong interest in learning entrepreneurship
- Suggests: Educational product

Landscape analysis (50+ sources):
- Operational tools showing higher growth
- Educational market crowded
- Suggests: Operational product

Instead of picking one, help me find a frame where both could be true. What would it mean if both data sources are valid?
```

### Claude's Response (Paraphrased)
> These aren't contradictory—they're capturing different stages of the same journey.
>
> **Survey insight:** Where users ARE (they want to learn, they're at the beginning)
> **Landscape insight:** Where the market IS GOING (execution tools, operational value)
>
> Your survey respondents will eventually need operational tools—after they learn. The landscape shows where value accrues long-term.
>
> **Synthesis:** Start with education (meet users where they are), then layer operational tools (capture the value the market rewards).

## Observations

### Why "Both/And" Worked

1. **Different time horizons**
   - Survey = present state of user needs
   - Landscape = future state of market opportunity
   - Both valid, just measuring different things

2. **User journey mapping**
   - Learning → Doing is a natural progression
   - Educational product acquires users at learning stage
   - Operational product retains them at doing stage

3. **Risk reduction**
   - Phase 1 (educational) validates demand at lower cost
   - Phase 2 (operational) informed by Phase 1 learnings
   - Failing at Phase 1 costs less than failing at Phase 2

4. **Precedent validation**
   - HubSpot: Taught inbound marketing → Built CRM
   - Mailchimp: Email templates (easy) → Marketing automation (complex)
   - Pattern: Education builds trust, operations builds revenue

### What This Changed

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Which data do I trust?" | "What does each data source reveal?" |
| Binary recommendation | Phased recommendation |
| Defend one source, dismiss other | Synthesize both into coherent strategy |
| Weak argument (single evidence base) | Strong argument (multiple evidence bases) |

## Analysis

### When "Both/And" Works

- Data sources measure different things (time, stage, segment)
- There's a logical sequence between the two signals
- You have flexibility on timeline (can phase)
- Stakes are high enough to warrant synthesis effort

### When "Either/Or" Is Appropriate

- Data sources directly contradict on same dimension
- One source is clearly methodologically superior
- Speed matters more than nuance
- Resources only allow one path

### Red Flags for Forced Synthesis

- You're rationalizing a predetermined preference
- The "both" option is actually "neither" in disguise
- Stakeholders need a clear, singular direction
- Phasing isn't actually feasible given constraints

## How I Use This Now

### The Prompt Pattern
```
I have data suggesting [DIRECTION A] and other data suggesting [DIRECTION B].

Before I pick one, help me explore:
1. What is each data source actually measuring?
2. Could these be capturing different stages/dimensions?
3. Is there a frame where both are valid?
4. What would a "both/and" approach look like?

If they truly conflict, help me evaluate which to weight more heavily and why.
```

### The Mental Model

When data conflicts, ask:
1. **Same dimension?** If measuring same thing → one is probably wrong
2. **Different dimensions?** If measuring different things → synthesis possible
3. **Sequence possible?** If yes → phased approach
4. **Sequence impossible?** → Make a call, document reasoning

## Measured Impact

**Vibe Project Outcome:**
- Phased recommendation accepted by CEO and Research Director
- Avoided the "pick one and defend it" trap
- Created optionality (Phase 2 informed by Phase 1 results)
- Stronger stakeholder buy-in (both camps saw their data respected)

---

## Key Takeaway

Conflicting data isn't a problem to solve—it's information about complexity. The synthesis often produces better strategy than either source alone.

The instinct to "pick the right data" is usually wrong. The instinct to "find the frame where both are true" is usually right.

## Still Exploring

- [ ] Does this pattern hold for data conflicts within the same source type?
- [ ] When does "either/or" actually produce better outcomes?
- [ ] How do stakeholders respond to "both/and" vs. decisive single-path recommendations?
