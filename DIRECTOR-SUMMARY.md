### Working with Claude: A Partnership Model

I've developed a systematic partnership with Claude that divides responsibilities between two modes:

**Claude AI = Project Manager** | **Claude Code = Research Assistant**

This isn't ad-hoc prompting—it's a structured collaboration where each mode has clear responsibilities that complement my work as Product Lead.

---

#### Claude AI as Project Manager

Claude AI (via claude.ai with MCP integrations) handles project coordination and information synthesis across tools.

**What Claude AI Does:**

| Responsibility | Example from Vibe |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Cross-system visibility** | Queries Asana + Drive simultaneously to generate status updates |
| **Task creation & tracking** | Creates tasks directly in Asana Knowledge Base with proper categorization |
| **Progress reporting** | Generates leadership briefs by pulling completed tasks and deliverables |
| **Meeting preparation** | Synthesizes relevant documents before stakeholder meetings |
| **Decision support** | Frames strategic tensions with evidence from multiple sources |

**Concrete Example - Weekly Status:**
Instead of manually checking Asana and Drive, I prompt Claude AI:
> "Review my Vibe project in Asana and Drive. What was completed this week? What's blocked? Generate a leadership brief."

Claude AI pulls from both systems and produces a draft status report in minutes.

**Concrete Example - Strategic Recommendation:**
When survey data (educational focus) conflicted with market analysis (operational opportunity), Claude AI helped synthesize:
> "Both data sources are valid—they measure different journey stages. Survey captures where users ARE; landscape reveals where the market IS GOING."

This led to the phased hybrid strategy that achieved executive buy-in.

---

#### Claude Code as Research Assistant

Claude Code (this instance) handles document analysis, research synthesis, and systematic documentation.

**What Claude Code Does:**

| Responsibility | Example from Vibe |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Large-scale document analysis** | Processing 10,000+ Quatere documents for inventory and prioritization |
| **Research synthesis** | Landscape analysis with 50+ sources, cross-verified statistics |
| **Methodology documentation** | This portfolio—systematic capture of workflows and learnings |
| **Evidence compilation** | Competitive analysis of 33+ organizations with structured comparison |
| **Report generation** | This director summary, compiled from multiple sources |

**Concrete Example - Landscape Analysis:**
Claude Code conducted systematic research:
- 10-15 targeted searches across government, academic, industry, nonprofit sources
- 50+ sources analyzed with recency bias (90% from 2023-2025)
- Key finding surfaced: Zero of 33+ organizations serve Rising Talent as defined
- Output: Citation-backed, presentation-ready analysis in hours vs. weeks

**Concrete Example - Document Inventory:**
Sprint 1 required analyzing 10,000+ documents from Quatere:
- Claude Code created inventory and categorization framework
- Identified foundational MOKR documents for priority analysis
- Enabled systematic prioritization of remaining ~9,900 documents

**What stays with me:**
- Final decisions and judgment calls
- Stakeholder relationships and organizational navigation
- Team leadership and cross-functional coordination
- Quality validation of all outputs

#### Results of This Partnership

| Metric | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Landscape analysis time | Hours instead of weeks |
| Document inventory | 10,000+ docs systematically processed |
| Research quality | 50+ sources, 100% citation rate |
| Strategic synthesis | Conflicting data → Actionable recommendation |
| Executive communication | Decision-ready outputs, CEO buy-in achieved |

---

#### Scaling to the Team

The **Claude Project Instructions** document in Drive codifies this approach for the team, including:
- Methodology adaptation framework for Rising Talent constraints
- Standard prompts for common tasks
- Quality validation requirements

**Claude Skills in development** (Brendan):
- Document inventory generator
- YouTube transcript extraction

This enables consistent AI-assisted work across the project, not just for my tasks.
