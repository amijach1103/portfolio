# AI-Augmented Product Management Portfolio

> **Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress — This portfolio is actively being developed. Content reflects ongoing projects and evolving methodologies.

A systematic collection of methodologies, case studies, and learnings from AI-assisted product management work.

## About Me

**Agueda Schwartz** | Product Manager | 14+ years in EdTech | Research & Operations

I turn ambiguous challenges into actionable products through systematic research, cross-functional coordination, and evidence-based methodology. My background spans K-12, higher education, and corporate learning, with deep expertise in program evaluation and operational excellence.

Currently pioneering AI-assisted workflows that reduce research time by 85% while maintaining rigor — building scalable processes that bridge strategy and execution.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't "I use ChatGPT." This is:
- **Systematic methodologies** being developed and refined through real projects
- **Documented workflows** with honest assessments of what works and what doesn't
- **Evidence-based outputs** with citations and verifiable sources
- **Measured outcomes** where available, with acknowledgment of ongoing measurement

## Repository Structure

### [`/case-studies`](./case-studies)
Deep dives into strategic problems solved with AI assistance. Each includes business context, methodology, iterations, and outcomes.

**Featured:** [AI Entrepreneurship Platform](./case-studies/ai-entrepreneurship-platform.md) — 0-to-1 strategic research initiative. Synthesized 50+ sources into actionable recommendation that achieved executive buy-in.

### [`/prompting-patterns`](./prompting-patterns)
Reusable prompt templates organized by PM use case. These are working documents that evolve as I learn:
- Research & Analysis
- Executive Communication
- Stakeholder Synthesis
- Evidence-Based Recommendations

### [`/experiments`](./experiments)
The messy middle—iterations, failures, and what I learned. This section will grow as I document more learnings.

### [`/projects`](./projects)
Deliverables and artifacts (to be added as projects reach appropriate milestones).

## Emerging Methodologies

*These approaches are being developed and refined. Metrics are directional, not final.*

### Systematic Landscape Analysis
- Structured research process with source diversity requirements (government, academic, industry, nonprofit)
- Consistent citation and verification standards (APA format, cross-verified statistics)
- 85% time reduction vs. traditional approaches (3-4 hours vs. 2-3 weeks)

### Two-Phase Prompting
1. **Theory:** "What does research say about this?"
2. **Execution:** "Follow the implementation steps"
- Pattern for moving from recommendations to action

### Executive Communication Framework
**Structure:** Tension → Recommendation → Rationale → Implications → Next Steps
- Being refined through actual stakeholder presentations

## Preliminary Outcomes

*These metrics are based on initial projects and will be validated over time.*

| Metric | Observed So Far | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Research time | Significant reduction | Comparing to previous manual approaches |
| Source quality | 50+ sources per analysis | With APA citations |
| Stakeholder reception | Positive | Based on project feedback |

## Core Competencies (In Development)

| Area | Being Demonstrated Through |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Strategic Research** | Landscape analysis methodology development |
| **Cross-Functional Coordination** | Ongoing project work |
| **Executive Communication** | Presentations and recommendations |
| **AI Integration** | Systematic workflow documentation |
| **Evidence-Based Approach** | Citation and verification practices |

## How I'm Working With AI

1. **"Validate each fact always"** — Testing user preferences for quality control
2. **Start with intent** — Define the problem before reaching for AI
3. **Iterate and document** — Capture what works and what doesn't
4. **Measure where possible** — Track outcomes to validate approaches
5. **Acknowledge limits** — Document when AI isn't the right tool

---

## What's Next

- [ ] Complete documentation of existing learnings (14 identified)
- [ ] Refine case study with final project outcomes
- [ ] Add more prompting patterns as they're tested
- [ ] Document failures and pivots (experiments section)
- [ ] Validate preliminary metrics with additional projects

## How This Portfolio Is Maintained

This portfolio is updated through a systematic capture process:
- Weekly quick captures of learnings and iterations
- Monthly deep documentation of methodology refinements
- Milestone updates as projects progress
