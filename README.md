# AI-Augmented Product Management Portfolio

> **Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress — This portfolio is actively being developed. Content reflects ongoing projects and evolving methodologies.

A systematic collection of methodologies, case studies, and learnings from AI-assisted product management work.

## About Me

**Agueda Schwartz** | EdTech Product Manager | 14+ years experience

I turn ambiguous challenges into learning experiences that work. My background spans corporate L&D, K-12, and higher education, with a strong research foundation and evidence-based approach.

Currently exploring AI as a working partner in learning contexts — building workflows that maximize quality while creating space for upskilling and supporting others.

**Asana Knowledge Base:** [Project Tracker](https://app.asana.com/1/939736045937044/project/1212290960713676/list/1212309895406620)

## What Makes This Different

This isn't "I use ChatGPT." This is:
- **Systematic methodologies** being developed and refined through real projects
- **Documented workflows** with honest assessments of what works and what doesn't
- **Evidence-based outputs** with citations and verifiable sources
- **Measured outcomes** where available, with acknowledgment of ongoing measurement

---

## Repository Structure

### [`/case-studies`](./case-studies)
Deep dives into strategic problems solved with AI assistance. Each includes business context, methodology, iterations, and outcomes.

**In Progress:** [AI Entrepreneurship Platform](./case-studies/ai-entrepreneurship-platform.md) — Strategic research and recommendation development for an innovation initiative.

### [`/prompting-patterns`](./prompting-patterns)
Reusable prompt templates organized by PM use case. These are working documents that evolve as I learn:
- Research & Analysis
- Executive Communication
- Stakeholder Synthesis
- Evidence-Based Recommendations

### [`/experiments`](./experiments)
The messy middle—iterations, failures, and what I learned. This section will grow as I document more learnings.

### [`/projects`](./projects)
Deliverables and artifacts (to be added as projects reach appropriate milestones).

## Emerging Methodologies

*These approaches are being developed and refined. Metrics are directional, not final.*

### Systematic Landscape Analysis
- Structured research process with source diversity requirements
- Working toward consistent citation and verification standards
- Early results suggest significant time savings vs. traditional approaches

### Two-Phase Prompting
1. **Theory:** "What does research say about this?"
2. **Execution:** "Follow the implementation steps"
- Pattern for moving from recommendations to action

### Executive Communication Framework
**Structure:** Tension → Recommendation → Rationale → Implications → Next Steps
- Being refined through actual stakeholder presentations

---

## Preliminary Outcomes

*These metrics are based on initial projects and will be validated over time.*

| Metric | Observed So Far | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Research time | Significant reduction | Comparing to previous manual approaches |
| Source quality | 50+ sources per analysis | With APA citations |
| Stakeholder reception | Positive | Based on project feedback |

---

## Core Competencies (In Development)

| Area | Being Demonstrated Through |
|------|---------------------------|
| **Strategic Research** | Landscape analysis methodology development |
| **Cross-Functional Coordination** | Ongoing project work |
| **Executive Communication** | Presentations and recommendations |
| **AI Integration** | Systematic workflow documentation |
| **Evidence-Based Approach** | Citation and verification practices |

## How I'm Working With AI

1. **"Validate each fact always"** — Testing user preferences for quality control
2. **Start with intent** — Define the problem before reaching for AI
3. **Iterate and document** — Capture what works and what doesn't
4. **Measure where possible** — Track outcomes to validate approaches
5. **Acknowledge limits** — Document when AI isn't the right tool

---

## What's Next

- [ ] Complete documentation of existing learnings (14 identified)
- [ ] Refine case study with final project outcomes
- [ ] Add more prompting patterns as they're tested
- [ ] Document failures and pivots (experiments section)
- [ ] Validate preliminary metrics with additional projects

---
